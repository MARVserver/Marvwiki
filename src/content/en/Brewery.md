# BreweryX Recipes

On the MARV server, you can brew various alcoholic drinks using the BreweryX plugin. Here is how the process works and a list of recipes.

## Gameplay Guide

### 1. Brewing
1. Get a **Cauldron** and fill it with water. Add a heat source underneath (Fire, Campfire, Magma, etc.).
2. Add ingredients by right-clicking the cauldron with each item.
3. Use a **Clock** on the cauldron to check the elapsed time.
4. When ready, use 3 glass bottles to extract the brew.

### 2. Distilling
Some recipes require distillation.
1. Place the brew in a **Brewing Stand** (top slot) and put **Glowstone Dust** in the bottom filter slot.
2. Repeat according to the required distillation count.

### 3. Aging
Aging takes place in barrels to improve quality or finish specific brews.

#### Creating a Barrel
There are two sizes of barrels. The "Sign" and the "Type of Wood" are critical for the process.

**Small Barrel:**
- Use **8 Wooden Stairs** to create a box shape with the stairs facing outward.
- Place a **Sign** on the front and type `Barrel` on the first line.
- Provides **1 page** of storage.

**Big Barrel:**
- Build a larger wooden structure (e.g., 5x3x3 or 4x4x4).
  - Combine fences, stairs, and planks to create a barrel shape.

- Place a **Sign** on the front and type `Barrel` on the first line. If successful, you will see a confirmation message.
- Provides **multiple pages** of storage for mass production.

#### Aging Process
Place the drink inside the barrel. 1 in-game day equals 1 "year" of aging. 
The optimal "Aging Years" and "Type of Wood" (Oak, Birch, Jungle, Acacia, Dark Oak, Spruce) vary by recipe.
