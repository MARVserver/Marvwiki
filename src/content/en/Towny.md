# Towny Management Guide

Learn how to create and manage your own Town on the MARV Earth server.

## 1. Creating a Town
Having your own town allows you to protect land and recruit residents.

- **Command**: `/town create {name}`
  - Requires a creation fee.
  - The chunk you are standing in will become the Homeblock.

## 2. Claiming Land
Expand your town's territory by claiming surrounding chunks.

- **Command**: `/town claim`
  - You can only claim chunks adjacent to your existing territory.

## 3. Upkeep and Bank
Towns require a daily upkeep fee to remain active.

- **Deposit money**: `/town deposit {amount}`
  - Deposit funds into the Town Bank.
  - If the bank runs out of money, the town will fall!
- **Check Status**: `/town`

## 4. Residents
Invite other players to join your community.

- **Invite**: `/town invite {player}`
- **Leave**: `/town leave`

## 5. Plots
Divide your town land into plots for residents to own or rent.

- **Set for sale**: `/plot forsale {price}`
- **Claim plot**: `/plot claim`
